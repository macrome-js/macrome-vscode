# macrome-vscode

IDE support for the [macrome](https://github.com/macrome-js/macrome) build system. Work in progress.

## Features

Generated files in the file tree appear dimmed. Currently they use `gitDecoration.ignoredResourceForeground` (defined by your theme). Files beginning with an `@macrome` annotation are considered generated.
